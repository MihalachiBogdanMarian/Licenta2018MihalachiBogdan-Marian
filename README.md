Application objectives: visual representation of an algorithm of traversing a graph-map through a 3D animation
  - generating a random paths map based on an oriented and acyclic graph structure
  - modeling and animating a horse which will be able to walk, run and jump over obstacles
  - the horse must traverse the optimum path of the map (maximum cost path - maximum number of obstacles) - dynamic programming algorithm
  - recognition of obstacles placed on the path and avoiding them accordingly

Use cases of the application
  - learning support for graph and collision algorithms
  - game industry
  - cartoons
